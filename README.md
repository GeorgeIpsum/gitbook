# Hello, world

This is my personal knowledge base: random snippets of information that I've picked up by browsing the web or reading elsewhere.

## What sort of things are you gonna put here?

Pretty much anything I learn about while reading. Could be random tidbits about developing extensions for web browsers to Pok√©mon meta changes.

## Why don't you just use bookmarks?

Writing about what I've learned helps me cement that knowledge. It's also a lot easier for me to organize the relevant bits of info that I read this way.
