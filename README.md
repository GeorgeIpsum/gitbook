# hello, world

This is my personal knowledge base: random snippets of information \(or perhaps plain junk that I find neat\) that I've picked up while browsing the web or reading elsewhere.

## What sort of things are you gonna put here?

Pretty much anything I learn about while reading. Could be random tidbits about developing extensions for web browsers to Pok√©mon meta changes to "oh, so THAT'S how you do that in git."

## Why don't you just use bookmarks?

Writing about what I've learned helps me cement that knowledge. It's also a lot easier for me to organize the relevant bits of info that I read this way.

## Why use Gitbook?

It was as easy as signing up, adding a CNAME record, and then start typing. I might migrate to something else once I get the time, but being able to just Get Started in less than 5 minutes is nice.

## There's a lot of things here.

Hey! That's not a question! Also mostly everything here is empty, but I'm gonna try and dump stuff eventually.
